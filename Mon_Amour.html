  <h2>For My Juliet</h2>
  
  <pre>
    Moments, they've been everything
And just like magic, can make the whole world sing[I love every single moment I had with you]
.
That look in your eyes, oh, the joy it brings[with those tiny eyes of yours]
.
When I hold you and you hold me[ðŸ’›you held me tight and it felt like home] 
I know we're not, not what we used to be
But we carry so much history
Put up my sails and I rode the wind
That led me here to you, I'd do it all again[ðŸ’›mekleflefed me to you]

When you're far from home, it's hard to know the way[but itsh okay]
But it's right there insideðŸ«€

When you need direction
Look to the stars
If you don't know where you're heading
Follow your heartðŸ«€
When you're lost I will guide you[me clumsy but me with you]
I'm right there beside you[ðŸ’›always]
.
.
.
We may take the long road[we most definitely talking the long road]
But I'll never fade[I'll try not to]
When you're lost I will guide you
Oh, tell me you'll try to
Remember on the darker days[ðŸ–¤]
.
.

I see you there when I'm in my dreams[dreams will be all we'll have]
.
.
I know it won't always be the same[and certainly not easy]
.
When you're far from home, it's hard to know the way
But it's right there inside

Oh-oh, when you need direction
Try close your eyes
If you don't know where you're heading
Just hold on tight
When you're lost I will guide you
'Cause I'm right here beside you
In every memory
And just like a compass
That leads the way
We may take the long road
But I'll never fade
When you're lost I will guide you
Oh, tell me you'll try to
Remember on the darker days
Love is a compass
